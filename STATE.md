# Robot Project Status Report
**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**System:** RPi-Robot (Raspberry Pi 5, Ubuntu, Docker, ROS 2 Iron)

## 1. Current Working Components
- Video Stream: operational via web_video_server (`/stream?topic=/camera/image_raw`).
- System Metrics: CPU temperature + uptime displayed correctly.
- Networking: Nginx proxy healthy; dashboard reachable; inter-container DNS OK.

## 2. Partially Working / In Progress
- Dashboard Stats: CPU%, memory%, disk% placeholders still blank.
- netstatus: serving temp/uptime; needs more metrics endpoints.
- RoboClaw: in bootloader recovery; USB recognized; Motion Studio pending.

## 3. Outstanding Issues
1) Extend netstatus to expose CPU%, Mem%, Disk%, (optional) Net I/O.
2) Complete RoboClaw firmware recovery and regain motor control.
3) Verify all containers restart on boot.
4) Add backup automation via systemd timer (script exists).

## 4. Next Steps
- Short-term: expand netstatus; wire up dashboard; retest.
- Long-term: GPS integration; patrol/security features; manual driving controls.
