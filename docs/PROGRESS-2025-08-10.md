# Robot Project — Progress Summary
**Date:** 2025-08-10

## Highlights
- GitHub repo live (`amhogan/robot-project`) and synced from RPi-Robot.
- Repo bootstrapped: STATE.md, docker/, services/netstatus/, site/, scripts/, .gitignore.
- Netstatus Flask service in place (/status, /status_temp, /status_uptime).
- Dashboard served by nginx; needs re-point to repo mounts to show CPU temp/uptime widgets.
- SMB backup path working with NAS user **robotbackup** (target: //10.22.22.11/7tb/share).
- Windows access to RPi-Frank fixed by clearing cached creds and explicit login.
- Plan to offload builds to NAS at /mnt/robot-builds; initial CIFS mount attempt hit Permission denied (will retry with options/ACLs).

## Current State
- Git backup script added; can commit/push repo changes to GitHub.
- NAS creds file created at ~/.smb-7tb.creds.
- CIFS mount needs tuning (sec=ntlmssp, domain=WORKGROUP, verify ACLs).

## Open Issues
1) Finish CIFS mount of //10.22.22.11/7tb → /mnt/robot-builds and create /robot-builds subfolder.
2) Ensure video-dashboard mounts from ~/robot-project/site and proxies /api routes.
3) Add systemd timer for Git backups (and optional NAS backups if desired).
4) RoboClaw recovery when hardware is ready.

## Next Steps (proposed)
- Retry manual mount with: `-o credentials=...,vers=3.0,sec=ntlmssp,domain=WORKGROUP,uid=pi,gid=pi`.
- Confirm /api/status* JSON loads via nginx and surface CPU temp/uptime on dashboard.
- Add systemd timer unit for git backups (02:20 daily).
